Abstract. This article was created as part of a Problem Based Learning (PBL) project in which
we investigated delta robots, CNC machines and embedded systems. In response to the imperatives
of Industry 4.0, this research introduces "DeltaSort", a delta robot system poised to revolutionize
agricultural sorting processes. Through the integration of advanced gripping mechanisms and
artificial intelligence-driven object recognition, DeltaSort meticulously assesses and categorizes
harvested fruits and vegetables, ensuring judicious force application for gentle handling and
precise sorting. Beyond the confines of agriculture, the system presents a plethora of advantages,
encompassing heightened productivity, superior precision, elevated safety standards, increased
production speeds, and non-stop operational capability, rendering it an instrumental solution in
contemporary automated processes.
