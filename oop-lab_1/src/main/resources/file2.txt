Abstract. The purpose of this article is to explain how a domain-specific language may be useful
in marketing. The benefits of using a domain-specific language in email automation are examined
in the article, including increased precision, quicker processing times, reduced error rates, etc.
DSL-based automation improves the client experience and makes the workflow more seamless.
The DSL's functionality, grammatical characteristics, and other details are covered in the article
along with the processes that were used to design it. By focusing on key components such as
campaign management, personalization, automation, integration, and analytics, this new
language equips users with the tools and capabilities they need to elevate their email marketing
efforts in an increasingly digital world. The abstract syntax tree was created using a formal
grammar as its foundation. The ANTLR 4 parser generator is used as the front-end for the DSL
built as explained in this article. Python is used to implement the back end.
